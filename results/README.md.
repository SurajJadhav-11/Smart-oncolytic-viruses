# Simulation Results & Data Interpretation

This folder contains the quantitative validation of the 3-Lock Smart Oncolytic Virus (OV) architecture. The data below represents the "Dry-Lab" phase of research, focusing on viral kinetics and safety logic thresholds.

## 1. Viral Kinetics Analysis (Lock 1 & 3)
**Objective:** To compare the efficacy of the 3-Lock "Smart" OV against a standard oncolytic virus in a KRAS-mutant tumor environment.

* **Standard OV:** Shows a rapid initial spike but follows a standard decay curve as the host immune system (Lock 3) clears the unprotected virus.
* **3-Lock Architecture:** Demonstrates a stabilized viral titer. The "Hardware" shield (Cleavable PEG) allows for sustained replication by delaying immune clearance until the tumor-specific protease threshold is met.

## 2. RNA Sequestration Logic (Lock 2)
**Objective:** To validate the safety clearance of viral RNA in healthy (non-target) cells using a logarithmic decay model.

* **Healthy Cell Clearance:** The simulation confirms that the "Foreign Fragment" triggers immediate sequestration and degradation. The viral RNA concentration drops below the **Safety Clearance Threshold (0.1)** within the first 12–18 hours.
* **Tumor Cell Stability:** In the absence of the sequestration trigger, viral RNA remains stable, allowing for successful translation and therapeutic effect.
