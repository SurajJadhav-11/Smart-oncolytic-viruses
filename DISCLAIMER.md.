# Intellectual Property & Confidentiality Notice

This repository represents the public-facing computational validation of the 3-Lock Smart Oncolytic Virus (OV) architecture. 

## 1. Redaction of Proprietary Data
To protect ongoing patent filings and proprietary research, the following elements have been intentionally redacted from this public repository:
* **Genetic Sequences:** Specific nucleotide sequences for the synthetic riboswitches and RNA sequestration fragments.
* **Core Logic Constants:** Precise biochemical constants used in the "Private Vault" version of the simulation.
* **Structural Blueprints:** Detailed molecular docking configurations for the cleavable PEG shield.

## 2. Usage & Collaboration
The "Lite" Python scripts provided here are for **demonstration and logic-validation purposes only**. 
* **Copyright:** All theoretical architectures and mathematical models are the intellectual property of [Suraj Suresh Jadhav].
* **Inquiries:** For academic collaboration or full technical whitepaper access (under NDA), please contact the lead researcher directly.

## 3. Ethical Statement
This research adheres to the ethical guidelines for dual-use biological research. The modeling is intended solely for therapeutic applications in oncology.
